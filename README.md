# üëã Hello, I'm Karol
I'm a **Junior Data Engineer** and **SAS Consultant** with a deep interest in technology, data-driven solutions, and continuous learning. Over the past few years, I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to work in the **automotive** and **banking industries**, tackling challenges that require data manipulation, automation, and efficient systems management. My work is rooted in the belief that **technology should drive smart decision-making**, and I‚Äôm passionate about discovering tools and methodologies that make a tangible difference.


## üå± Personal Projects (some of them)
I always enjoy testing new ideas, and my personal projects reflect my curiosity for scalable systems and efficient workflows:

- **[Library Management System](https://github.com/kurekhombre/Library)**: A robust system built using Python, MS SQL, FastAPI, and Docker, with an ETL pipeline that efficiently handles data operations.
- 
- **[Air Pollution Monitoring Platform](https://github.com/kurekhombre/AirPollution)**: An advanced data processing platform using BigQuery, Databricks, and GCP, designed to monitor and analyze air quality data at scale.
- 
- **[myShop](https://github.com/kurekhombre/myShop)**: Simple shop using Django builded with Tailwind CSS & HTMX and Stripe payment processing.


## üìÇ My Repositories
Here‚Äôs where I keep various resources, course materials, and project repositories related to my learning journey and professional development:

- **[KnowledgeHub](https://github.com/kurekhombre/KnowledgeHub)**  
  A repository where I organize the **books, courses, and video tutorials** that I have studied or plan to study. It‚Äôs my go-to resource for continuous learning in various domains like data engineering, cloud computing, and software development.

- **[CS-Engineering](https://github.com/kurekhombre/CS-Engineering)**  
  This repository contains materials from my **Computer Science studies** at WSB Merito University. It includes projects, assignments, and code examples that showcase the skills and knowledge I developed during my time there.

- **[SDACourse](https://github.com/kurekhombre/SDACourse)**  
  A repository dedicated to the **Python course** I completed, where I built projects and honed my skills in **Python programming**, including libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas**. You can find my projects and solutions here.

- **[Mentoring](https://github.com/kurekhombre/Mentoring)**  
  This repository documents my journey through a **mentorship program** I‚Äôve been part of. It includes notes, exercises, and projects I‚Äôve worked on under the guidance of a senior data engineer, focusing on advanced topics like **Big Data**, **GCP**, and **Docker**.

- **[Smart Home Project (Private)](https://github.com/kurekhombre/Flat)**  
  My private project focusing on creating a **smart home** system, integrating various IoT devices for home automation. The project explores the intersection of **Python**, **Raspberry Pi**, and **Home Assistant**. I might open source it in the future as it evolves.

Feel free to check out these repositories to see how I approach learning and applying new technologies!


## üí° My Learning Approach
My philosophy towards learning and mastering new technology is simple:
1. **Master the Basics** ‚Äì I always start by getting a firm grip on the fundamentals, ensuring I can navigate the core concepts with confidence.
2. **Explore Use Cases** ‚Äì After mastering the basics, I explore real-world applications, focusing on how each tool or framework can solve real problems.
3. **Compare Alternatives** ‚Äì Finally, I make it a point to evaluate various tools to ensure I‚Äôm using the best fit for each problem. For example:
   - **Web Development**: Django vs. FastAPI
   - **Messaging & Event Streaming**: Kafka vs. Pub/Sub
   - **Infrastructure as Code**: Ansible vs. Terraform
   - **Data Analytics**: SAS vs. Databricks

When a tool captures my interest or shows significant promise in addressing a need, I dive deeper into the **theory behind it** and apply it in real-world **projects** to better understand its strengths and limitations.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Expertise
Throughout my career, I‚Äôve developed a diverse set of skills and proficiencies:
- **Programming & Data Analysis**:  
  - SAS
  - Python
- **Database Management & SQL**:  
  - Oracle, PL/SQL and MS SQL, T-SQL
  - Databricks
- **Big Data & ETL Technologies**:  
  - Spark, Kafka, BigQuery, ETL pipelines  
- **Cloud & DevOps/ Administration**:  
  - Docker  
  - Google Cloud Platform (GCP)  
  - Linux, Bash, Ansible and Windows, PowerShell
- **ETL & Data Integration**:  
  - Extensive experience with SAS Data Integration Studio and custom Python scripts for pipeline automation and troubleshooting.


## ü§ù Open to Collaboration
Though I‚Äôm currently working in the industry, I‚Äôm always looking to collaborate on **interesting projects** that challenge me and allow me to grow my skill set. Whether it‚Äôs a data engineering problem, automating a complex workflow, or building scalable systems, I‚Äôm excited to see where we can innovate together.
